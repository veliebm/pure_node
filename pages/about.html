<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Benjamin Velie.</p>

  I'm a software developer at the Center for the Study of Emotion and Attention.
  I also volunteer as a counselor for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

  I god damn love backend shit. If you have a gimmicky web project you wanna
  collaborate with me on, hit me up.
